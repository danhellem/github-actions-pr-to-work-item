## Outputs
The id of the work item created or update

## Example usage

1. Add a secret named `ADO_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` containing an [Azure Personal Access Token](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate) with "read & write" permission for Work Items

2. Add an optional secret named `GH_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` containing a [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.17/user/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) with "repo" permissions. See optional information below.

3. Install the [Azure Boards App](https://github.com/marketplace/azure-boards) from the GitHub Marketplace

4. Add a workflow file which responds to pull request events of `opened, edited, closed`

   - Set Azure DevOps organization and project details.
   - Set specific work item type settings (work item type, new state, active state, closed state)

   Optional Env Variables

   - `github_token`: Used to update the Issue with AB# syntax to link the work item to the issue. This will only work if the project is configured to use the [GitHub Azure Boards](https://github.com/marketplace/azure-boards) app.
   - `debug`: `true` for verbose logging to help debug problems. Remove this variable from the YAML file if you do not want to see verbose logging.
